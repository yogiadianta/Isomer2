Beyond building the island as a fun destination for all, SDC seeks to leverage new technologies and solutions to continuously enhance guest experience. As an active test-bed for innovations, Sentosa has established multiple collaborations with both the private and public sectors to create and test-bed new technologies and solutions. Visitors to the island can thus look forward to enhanced experiences in the near future as we develop a Smart Sentosa ecosystem.

### **MySentosa App**
As the new-generation of travellers become increasingly connected, SDC sees a need to engage them more on this front. As such, we are developing the One Sentosa Platform (OSP), which is an over-arching digital platform that unifies all forms of guest touchpoints so as to enhance overall guest experience and to increase our operational efficiency. 

A key feature of the OSP is the new version of the MySentosa app, which was first rolled out in 2012. Launched in January 2018, the revamped MySentosa app boasts features such as gamified trails and smart itinerary planning and smart navigation. Other mobile features in the development pipeline that appeal to new-gen travellers include a chatbot, mobile wallet and Augmented Reality experiences. 

#### **Tourism Information & Services Hub (TIH)**
Created by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), the Tourism Information & Services Hub (TIH) is a digital resource platform for tourism businesses to have access to relevant information on Singapore's tourism offerings and travel software services. SDC is working closely with STB to contribute information like the opening hours, latest promotions and events, etc of our attractions and offerings to TIH to generate greater awareness of Sentosaâ€™s offerings.

		<p>
			Between 26 August and 12 November 2019, as part of a three-month public trial, visitors and staff in Sentosa will be able to hail the autonomous shuttles via their smartphones or at kiosks along a 5.7km route. The autonomous mobility-on-demand solution is being developed by the Land Systems arm of ST Engineering, in partnership with the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC). The public trial will involve two types of autonomous vehicles (AVs), namely, two units of a 22-seater mini-bus, as well as two units of a smaller, 15-seater shuttle.
