Sentosa unveiled the tagline - The State of Fun in May 2014, in a significant move aimed at positioning Singapore’s iconic resort destination as the capital of fun for everyone.

The campaign is created to refresh the popular island resort’s brand image and heighten its emotional connection with Singaporeans and foreign guests, as they come to the island to enjoy its many leisure offerings and build fun memories with their friends and families.
The brand tagline The State of Fun forms the basis for the island’s marketing communications, from the promotion of its attractions, events and programming to its service delivery style.
