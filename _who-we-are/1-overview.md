Unique among leisure destinations, Sentosa (meaning peace and tranquility in Malay) is situated on the fringe of Singapore’s city centre, just minutes away from the central business district. The island is easily accessible via various modes of transport including the Sentosa Express from VivoCity and the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network which offers an aerial view of the HarbourFront precinct. Visitors can also choose to take a leisurely stroll via the Sentosa Boardwalk, the only garden-themed boardwalk in Southeast Asia. The island was formerly a fishing village and British military base during World War II and was transformed into an idyllic island resort in 1972 as a recreational space for Singaporeans to enjoy. Today, Sentosa has become a premier leisure destination with some 19 million local and foreign guests visiting the island annually.
