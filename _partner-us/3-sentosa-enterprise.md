The Sentosa x Enterprise scheme was launched in April 2019, as part of Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC)'s continued commitment to enhance the island's diverse array of unique leisure offerings.

Aimed at driving innovation among local enterprises, the Sentosa x Enterprise will create opportunities to test bed unique ideas, concepts, and technologies, while leveraging the holiday island's geographical attributes and environment.

### Innovation Focus
The focus areas for evaluation include Connectivity, Experience, Sustainability and Digital, as outlined below. Click <a href="#example-of-ideas">here</a> to see examples of ideas.

### How It Works

Sentosa x Enterprise offers a win-win partnership, where innovators and enterprises benefit from a risk-sharing arrangement while working on projects that could boost Sentosa's vibrancy and attractiveness.

Successful applicants will enjoy the co-sharing or waiver of venue rental, as well as support in terms of infrastructure and other facilitation resources. In turn, the innovation efforts are expected to drive visitorship to Sentosa, enhance guest satisfaction, and support SDC's environmental sustainability goals.
